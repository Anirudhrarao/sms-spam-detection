This is basically Machine learning model where i have used NLP and Machine learning algorithms (Bernoulli Naive Bayes).
if you type spam then result will spam and vice versa result.

### Bernoulli Naive Bayes:
This is used when features are binary. So, instead of using the frequency of the word, if you have discrete features in 1s and 0s that represent the presence or absence of a feature. In that case, the features will be binary and we will use Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

### Task Performed:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
* Convert all text in lower case
* Tokenization
* Removing special characters
* Removing stopwords and punctuation
* Stemming
